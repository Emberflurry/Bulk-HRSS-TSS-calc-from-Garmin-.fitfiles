# Bulk-HRSS-TSS-calc-from-Garmin-.fitfiles
calculate cardio training impact (HRSS/TSS/TRIMP) from heart rate data in Garmin activity (.fit) files, in bulk. Full automation (garmin site to a csv of activities and hrss) in progress. Done in python 3

Edit (6/19/22): Garmin API too expensive and third party scraper apps non-functional, probably will have to download individual workout files n put in bulk folder... :/
